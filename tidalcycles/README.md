Open a new window in Atom Editor.
Load the whole attached folder TidalCycles in the Project window.
Evaluate the code in the init.tidal file.
TidalCycles will now boot, make sure the path of the BootTidal.hs ends with .../TidalCycles/BootTidal.hs 
this means that TidalCycles booted with the attached boot file and not the default one.
Open the demo.tidal file and start messing around :)


PS
These instructions assume that you have tidalcycles correctly installed and running on your computer
