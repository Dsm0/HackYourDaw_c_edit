Create an instrument rack in Ableton Live with one of the attached devices and the instrument you want to control. 
The device must be the first element of the instrument rack.
Give a unique name to the device in the text window of the device. 
This will allow you to control the device from tidal using the   # sound "UniqueNameYouGaveToTheDevice"   synthax.
