Open a new window in Atom Editor.
Load the whole attached folder TidalCycles in the Project window.
Evaluate some code in the demo.tidal file or in any file that is in the same folder of the BootTidal.hs file.
TidalCycles will now boot, if something is not working make sure the path of the BootTidal.hs is the path corresponding to
the location of your directory.

PS
These instructions assume that you have tidalcycles correctly installed and running on your computer
